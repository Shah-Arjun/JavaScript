<!-- 
- Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where instead of adding event listeners to many child elements, you add one event listener to a common parent and let events bubble up.

- Then, inside the handler, you check which child triggered the event.

- It saves memory, improves performance, and is very useful when elements are created dynamically. 
-->


<!-- 🔹 Example Without Delegation ❌ -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>

<!-- Suppose we have a list: -->
<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>


<!-- If we want to handle clicks on each <li>, we might write: -->
<script>  

document.querySelectorAll("#menu li").forEach(item => {
  item.addEventListener("click", function() {
    alert("You clicked " + this.textContent);
  });
});

</script>

</body>
</html>


<!-- ⚠️ Problem: If new <li> items are added later, they won’t have event listeners. Also, too many listeners = bad for performance.
 -->




<!-- 🔹 Example With Event Delegation ✅ -->
document.getElementById("menu").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {  // check if li was clicked
    alert("You clicked " + event.target.textContent);
  }
});
